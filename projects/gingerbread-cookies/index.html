                <h2>Chewy Gingerbread Cookies</h2>
                <p>A few years back I had the best, chewiest gingerbread cookie at a party. I didn’t think to ask for the recipe. Big mistake. Since then I’ve been on what can only be described as a quest to find a good, chewy gingerbread recipe.</p>
                <div class="grid2">
                    <img src="/assets/photos/gingerbread_project.jpg" alt="Gingergread Cake Cookies">
                    <img src="/assets/photos/williamsburg-gingerbread.jpg" alt="Old-fashioned Williamsburg Gingerbread Cookies">
                </div>
                <p>I tried several recipes that claimed increasing the brown sugar to white sugar ratio would make the cookie chewier. This is lies. It does make the cookie gooier, but that is an entirely different thing than making the cookie chewier. 
                </p>
                <p>In a desperate attempt to avoid these gooey recipes, I googled “Gingerbread cake cookies” which, I know, is completely nonsensical. It involves three conflicting types of baked goods: bread, cake and cookies. But, what can I say, sometimes a girl wants it all. The search bore two promising results.
                </p>
                <p>First, to my delight, a recipe with the exact title ‘Gingerbread cake cookie’ (google, you sweet, sweet siren). And second, a recipe called ‘Old-fashioned Williamsburg Gingerbread Cookies’. Not obviously a chewy recipe, but I figured I’d take a chance and trust that the colonial bakers of yore knew their way around a gingerbread cookie.

                                    <li>2 tsp ginger</li>

                                    <li>½ cup evaporated milk</li>

Gradually add the flour. Make a ball out of the dough, and roll out on a well floured surface. Cut out the cookies and place on a baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes at 375 degrees.

                        <li>Do not attempt this baking while in bare feet or socks. If your kitchen is anything like mine, you will feel every crumb under your feet. Very unsettling.</li>

                    <h3 class="section-header">First up: Gingerbread Cake Cookies</h3>
                    <p>To start this recipe you combine the sugar and wet ingredients and then fold in the dry ingredients (if you need it, here’s a refresher on how to <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NywzrUJnmTo">fold in</a> ingredients). Thus far the recipe is delightfully easy. I am feeling quite good about things. Pause for my husband to pop into the kitchen and remind me that I put his whiskey glasses away in the wrong place (heaven forbid). We continue. Now, I’ve finalized the dough. It is very sticky. I try to use my hands to create balls to place on the cooking sheet. This is not going to work. My hands are instantly covered in sticky dough, and I pivot around the kitchen for a second like a doctor who’s just sterilized his hands. I switch to a spoon. One spoon is not enough. This is double-spoon situation. Double-spoon does the trick and I am able to get nice globs onto the cookie sheet. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Now that the cookies are in the oven it’s on to the frosting. This frosting recipe is genius. Who knew powdered sugar, vanilla, and orange juice would congeal so nicely into a lovely glaze? I feel like it should be harder, but it’s not. This is the best kind of DIY. Store bought frosting has nothing on this recipe. Once the cookies are out I drizzle the frosting on them and that’s it. Cookies complete.

                    <h3 class="section-header">Next up: Old-fashioned Williamsburg Gingerbread Cookies</h3>
                    <p>This recipe starts off a little shakier. It calls for softened butter. Softened butter is the worst. I’m sorry to be harsh, but it’s true. You will absolutely never remember to set out the butter ahead of time. And then, when you try to soften it via microwave it either melts too much or not enough. I’m convinced the concept of softened butter only exists so that the spirits of baker’s past can laugh at us from the afterlife. But, we press on. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Next up is the evaporated milk. This ingredient is showing the recipe’s age. Honestly, I had to google what this looked like to find it in the grocery store. And now I have ¾ of a can of evaporated milk (yes, it comes in a can) that will sit at the back of my refrigerator for eternity. The can also instructed me to shake well before opening. I’m skeptical. Nevertheless, we press on. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Despite these questionable ingredients (and the butter chunks caused by my no-so-softened butter) the dough actually comes together well. Unlike the Gingerbread Cake Cookies, this dough is meant to be rolled out. It rolls out nicely and I’m able to create my cookie cutouts. I lost my gingerbread man cookie cutter, so we do flowers. Deal with it.  Cookies are in the oven and we are all set.
